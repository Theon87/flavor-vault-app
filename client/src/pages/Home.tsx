//This willl be our home page

//We will need a header, a nav bar containg home, login, and my recipes.

//We will need a search bar to search for recipes on the page.

// Once we have the search bar we will need to display the recipes that match the search pulled from our api.

// When the user clicks on a recipe we will need to display the recipe details on a seperate page (recipe.tsx).

// Finally we'll need the footer
